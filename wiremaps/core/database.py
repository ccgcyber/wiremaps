functionality, there  is no seamless upgrade provided  to upgrade. You
should drop  the current database (with  dropdb) and create  a new one
(with createdb) and populate it with the content of database.sql, like
this was done when installing Wiremaps for the first time.

Alternatively, you  can just create  a new database (and  populate it)
and change wiremaps  configuration to use it. The  old database can be
used by another instance of Wiremaps or as a rollback.

After  this step,  you should  repopulate data  by asking  Wiremaps to
rebrowse all hosts.
